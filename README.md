It is a JavaScript program that outputs the code itself in C# and Python. 
If you run the solution.js, it will create a file named solution.csx ( A C# program )
When you run the solution.csx, it will create a file named solution.py ( A Python file )
And finally when you run the solution.py file it will generate a file named solution2.js, which is the identical of solution.js. ( solution.js == solution2.js ) 

Run this commands to check by yourself : 

`> node solution.js > solution.csx`
`> dotnet script solution.csx > solution.py`
`> python3 solution.py > solution2.js`
`> diff solution.js solution2.js`
`> `

If solution.js and solution2.js are identical, there will be no output
